  I've just created the gem, which is totally non-working. Please do not install. 
  I've just pushed it to get a feel for what to do. 

  The aim of Ruby on Skis is to provide a starting structure within which to program your wxRuby project. 
  The template provides a directory structure, a set of Rakefiles to manage, and most importantly, to 
  package your Ruby application for distribution as a standalone program when completed. It also includes 
  an environment to get the application running and provide basic services to the program code. 
  For now, the template only supports packaging for Mac OSX and Windows, although various flavors of 
  Linux should be easily accommodated and are planned for the future
