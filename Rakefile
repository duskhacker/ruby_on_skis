  This is the real deal! Download and Install away! 

  Ruby on Skis provides a template for your wxRuby project. 
  The template provides a directory structure, a set of Rakefiles to manage, and most importantly, 
  to _package_ your Ruby application for distribution as a standalone program. It also includes an environment 
  to get the application running and provide basic services to the program code. For now, the template only 
  supports packaging for Mac OSX -and Windows-, although various flavors of Linux should be easily 
  accommodated and are planned for the future.

  Note: Windows support has been removed in favor of getting a working generator and distributable gem in place.
